In todayâ€™s world, patients quite often take medications from multiple doctors. This causes the digital health data of the patient to be scattered in every hospital or clinic they visited.

So the patients have to carry all the previous records and documents physically for further treatment. These documents can stack up creating very bulky folders, that are also hard to compile for the patients.

Our project aims to solve the problem of fragmented digital patient data by having a central database that can be easily accessed by the doctors, allowing the patients of not having to carry around the physical documents, also enabling them of easy switching between doctors.

This is a backend project for a healthcare application. The project is built using JavaScript and leverages the power of Node.js and Express.js for server-side operations. It uses MongoDB as the database and Mongoose for object modeling.
